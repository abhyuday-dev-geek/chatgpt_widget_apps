    "question": "What’s the difference between Huggies, Pampers, and Luvs?",
    "answer": "Huggies diapers focus on gentle, hypoallergenic materials and leak protection with features like Double Grip Strips and contoured waistbands. Pampers tend to be softer, fragrance-forward, and prioritize wetness channels and all-night dryness. Luvs is a budget-friendly option offering essential leak protection at a lower price point. Parents often choose Huggies for sensitive-skin babies and secure fit.",
